    Hi there, how should I call you: XX

    --------------------------------------------------
    Hi XX, my name is Jianer Cong.
    Just call me Jianer.
    At the time of this writing, it's 18 May 2022.
    Today is Wednesday. Weekday.
    Now it's 12:12 PM,so perhaps I should say "Good Afternoon".

    I am 22 years old, to be exact, it's 8132 days (upto today).
    I am from UCL, short for University College London.
    It's a  4-year programme.I started it when I was 18.
    So, approximately  16 % of my life is spent in this place.

    If nothing goes wrong, I should be able to get a master degree this summer.
         Something that I am comfortable with are:
        python, C#, Linux, Engineering Mathmatics, and Data Analysis.

    That's it.
    This script is run by Python 3.8.10 under system Ubuntu 20.04.4.
